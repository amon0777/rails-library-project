<h1>About the Manitoba Public Libraries Web Application</h1>

<p>
  This web application was built to organize and display data about public libraries in Manitoba, Canada. 
  The platform enables users to browse and search for libraries, view their associated service areas, and analyze 
  various statistics such as active users, resources, and population served. The goal is to provide an easy-to-navigate, 
  data-driven tool for exploring the structure and performance of Manitoba's library system.

<h2>Data Sources (1.1)</h2>

<p>
  The application utilizes fictionalized and representative datasets that model the relationships between libraries, 
  their service areas, and collected statistical data. These datasets simulate how real-world public library systems 
  are organized and managed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Libraries:</strong> Each record represents a public library in Manitoba, including attributes such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Population served</li>
      <li>Whether the library is bilingual</li>
      <li>Whether the library is located in a northern community</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Service Areas:</strong> Libraries serve multiple service areas, and each service area contains:
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Associated library ID (foreign key)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Statistics:</strong> Statistical records are collected yearly for each service area. These include:
    <ul>
      <li>Year</li>
      <li>Active users</li>
      <li>Total population/li>
     
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These three models are related as follows: A <strong>Library</strong> has many <strong>Service Areas</strong>, 
  and each <strong>Service Area</strong> has many <strong>Statistics</strong>. This relationship enables the application 
  to provide hierarchical browsing, filtering, and reporting of library data.
